## What is SensAir?
* The SensAir application and device use sensors to relay air quality data directly to you. 

## Air Quality Metrics
* **Overall Air Quality**, measured on a scale of 1-100, is a general overview of your air quality. This value is based on an algorithm to determine if all conditions point to good or bad surrounding air quality.
 * Other info
* **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**, measured in parts per million (ppm), is harmful from a range of greater than 2000 ppm. CO2 is the combination of carbon with two oxygen atoms. It is also what we breathe out.

* **Toxic Volatile Organic Compounds(TVOC)**, measured in parts per billion (ppb), is harmful from a range of greater than 325 ppb.

| TVOC Level (mg/m3) 	    | Level of Concern 	        |
|------------------------	|------------------------	|
| Less than 0.3      	    | Low              	        |
| 0.3 to 0.5         	    | Acceptable       	        |
| 0.5 to 1           	    | Marginal         	        |
| 1 to 3             	    | High             	        |
