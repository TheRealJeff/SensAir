## What is SensAir?
* The SensAir application and device use sensors to relay air quality data directly to you. 
***
## Air Quality Metrics
* **Overall Air Quality**, measured on a scale of 1-100, is a general overview of your air quality. This value is based on an algorithm to determine if all conditions point to good or bad surrounding air quality.

#### **Toxic Volatile Organic Compounds(TVOC)**
 measured in parts per billion (ppb), is harmful from a range of greater than 325 ppb.Volatile Organic Compound or VOCs are organic chemicals that are released in the air by a variety of products. These sources can include vehicle exhaust, cigarette smoke, building materials (paint, glues, varnish, flooring materials) or household products (air fresheners, cleaning products). The organic chemicals become gases at room temperature and are the main origin of air pollution at ground level.

####**Humidity**
 measured in precentage, Simply put humidity is the amount of concentration of water vapor in the air. Combined with heat, it can have adverse effects on the human body as well as properties and furniture. Areas located around open bodies of water have higher levels of humidity especially in hotter climates.Humidity levels (both high or low) can have dire consequences and make living conditions unpleasant.
* __Symptoms (high humidity):__
 * Dehydration
 * Fatigue
 * Muscle cramps
 * Heat exhaustion
 * Fainting
 * Heat stroke
 * Lethargy
 * Headache
 * Confusion
 * vomiting
	
* **Symptoms (low humidity):**
 * Dry or itchy skin
 * Dry eyes
 * More rapid spread of infection
 * Nose bleeds
 * Static electricity
 * Physical damage to property

* **Actions to take in high humidity levels**
 * Running a dehumidifier
 * Open windows for an hour or two on dry days
 * Wear light weight clothes with lighter colors
 * Drink water and other hydrating non alcoholic drinks
 * Stay out of the sun

* **Actions to take in low humidity levels**
 * Drying clothes on a drying rack
 * Decrease indoor temperature, while keeping it above 15 degrees celsius
 * Use eye drops and lotion for itchy eyes and skin
 * Open the door while showering to spread humidity
 * Leave boiling water on the stove
