## What is SensAir?
* The SensAir application and device use sensors to relay air quality data directly to you. 

## Air Quality Metrics
* **Overall Air Quality**, measured on a scale of 1-100, is a general overview of your air quality. This value is based on an algorithm to determine if all conditions point to good or bad surrounding air quality.
 * Other info
* **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**, measured in parts per million (ppm), is harmful from a range of greater than 2000 ppm. CO2 is the combination of carbon with two oxygen atoms. It is also what we breathe out.

| 400-1000        	| Concentrations typical of occupied indoor spaces with good air exchange                                                                                  	|
| 1000-2000       	| Complaints of drowsiness and poor air                                                                                                                    	|
| 2000-5000       	| Headaches, sleepiness and stagnant, stale, stuffy air. Poor concentration, loss of attention, increased heart rate and slight nausea may also be present 	|
| 5000            	| Workplace exposure limit (as 8-hour TWA) in most jurisdictions                                                                                           	|
| >40,000         	| Exposure may lead to serious oxygen deprivation resulting in permanent brain damage, coma and even death                                                 	|

* **Toxic Volatile Organic Compounds(TVOC)**, measured in parts per billion (ppb), is harmful from a range of greater than 325 ppb.
